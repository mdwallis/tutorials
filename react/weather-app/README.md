# React Project: **Weather App**

## Summary
This is tutorial project has been created in an effort to provide a weather application that shows a 7-day forecast using React.

Credit goes to **Dave Ceddia** for the fantastic project recommentations and inspiration for project. Dave's specific project can be found here: [https://daveceddia.com/react-practice-projects/#weather-app](https://daveceddia.com/react-practice-projects/#weather-app)

While not an exact replica, the purpose is to continue learning React using functional components and to incorporate using the fetch HTML client and working with an external data provider.

The below screen shot displays the result of this project:

## To use
You will need to set your own OpenWeather API key in a local .env.local fil (or file you prefer to use). The following environment variable must be set:

<p>
    REACT_APP_OPEN_WEATHER_APP_ID=*** Your OpenWeather API Key Here***
</p>

Please visit the OpenWeather website for more information [https://openweathermap.org](

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
